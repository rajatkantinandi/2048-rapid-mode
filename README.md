<h2>HOW TO Play</h2>
<p>
  Move tiles by swiping or Arrow keys. 
  Combine 2 consecutive similar tiles to make bigger tiles.
  A new tile is generated on every turn.
  Your Goal is to reach tile 2048.
  When there no place for new tile & no way to combine any tile, then the game is over.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Rapid Mode: </b>
  In rapid mode tiles will combine in a direction until there is no merge possible in one go like a chain reaction.
  For example if you have 2, 2, 4, 8 then it will become 16 at once(2+2=4 -> 4+4=8 -> 8+8=16) & a new tile will be created.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Normal Mode: </b>
  In normal mode tiles will combine 2 at a time. Here 2, 2, 4, 8 will become 4, 4, 8 & a new tile will be created.
